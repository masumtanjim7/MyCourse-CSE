1. Initialize two integer type queues (amount and cost)
2. Take array size from the user and initialize an array
   2.1 Read coins from user and store into the array
3. Read total amount from the user

4. ENQUEUE all the coins and their count (initially 1) into amount and cost queues respectively

5. Infinite LOOP
   5.1 DEQUEUE coins from amount and count from cost
   5.2 Check wheter the coins and target amount are same
   5.3 If true, break the loop
   5.4 ELSE
       5.4.1 increase the count by 1
       5.4.2 LOOP through the original array of coins
             5.4.2.1 add previously checked coins with the current item of the array and Enqueue it into the amount queue
             5.4.2.1 enqueue the corresponding count into the cost queue


6. Print the count
